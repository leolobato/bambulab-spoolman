# Bambulab–Spoolman

## Overview

**Bambulab–Spoolman** is a Python backend application with a Flutter frontend that integrates:

- Bambu Lab Cloud  
- The Bambu printer local MQTT server  
- Spoolman  

It monitors 3D printing tasks, retrieves filament usage data, and generates detailed usage reports linked to your spool inventory.

> ⚠ This project is currently in **alpha stage**.  
> It is functional but still under active development, with ongoing improvements in usability and stability.

## Features

- Retrieves print task details from Bambu Cloud
- Obtains model weight per filament and filament names from the slicer (Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer)
- Monitors printer status in real time via MQTT
- Integrates with Spoolman to fetch spool data and generate usage reports
- Saves a history of prints
- Supports multicolor printing with AMS Lite
- Tracks print progress to estimate filament usage  
  - If a print is incomplete, filament usage is scaled according to completion percentage  
  - Note: Multicolor accuracy on incomplete prints may vary due to layer imbalance and uneven color distribution


## Limitations

- Tested only with a Bambu A1 + AMS Lite (other printers may work but are not guaranteed)
- Designed for a single printer setup
- Requires Bambu Cloud access to retrieve model weight and filament usage
- Filaments must be properly mapped in the slicer
- Only works for prints sent from the slicer to the printer  
  - Prints started from SD card or local-only connections will not provide weight data (this data is not transmitted via local MQTT)

# Installation & Usage

## Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will build the image and start the container. The web interface will be available at: http://localhost:2323

All persistent data (credentials, logs, filament mappings, task history) is stored in a `data/` directory mounted as a volume, so it survives container rebuilds.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To view logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Running Without Docker

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - paho-mqtt
  - requests
  - websockets

### Running the Application

Simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start the backend, launch the GUI, and serve the web interface at: http://localhost:2323

## First-Time Setup

On first launch:

Open the Settings tab in the GUI.

Enter:

- Spoolman IP address
- Spoolman port
- Printer local IP address
- Bambu Cloud login (email + password)

Save the settings.

Note: If required, a verification code may be sent to your email for Bambu Cloud authentication.

## Filament Mapping

After completing the settings:

Go to the Filament Map view.

Map slicer filaments (Bambu Studio / Orca Slicer) to Spoolman spools.

An automated matching algorithm suggests matches based on:

- Material
- Vendor
- Name

Manual adjustments can be made directly in the GUI.

# GUI Overview

The web interface created with Flutter (Port 2323) provides:

- List of recent print tasks
- Real-time terminal output
- Settings management
- Filament mapping interface
- Print history tracking

# Running Continuously

main.py must remain running continuously.

When using Docker, the container is configured with `restart: unless-stopped`, so it will automatically restart after reboots.

For non-Docker Linux or Raspberry Pi setups, it is recommended to configure it as a system service for automatic startup.

# Future Work

- Advanced GUI metrics and print analytics
- Graph generation and visualization tools
- Multi-printer support (filtered by ID)
- Possible slicer integration to avoid dependency on Bambu Cloud
- Improved error handling and stability enhancements
